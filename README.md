# Customer-Analysis2
In this project, we estimated a BB (Beta Binomial)  and BG-BB (Beta Geometric-Beta Binamial) Model of the cruise customers data and assessed how well models ﬁt. 

# Intro about company and data 
Joyful Voyages, Inc. (JV) runs vacation cruises to various destinations around the world. In 2009, the company acquired a new cohort of 18,402 customers who took their ﬁrst cruise that year. The ’cruises calib.txt’ ﬁle records all 26,748 cruises taken by this cohort from 2009 to 2014. By deﬁnition, all customers take a cruise in the year in which they are acquired (in this case, 2009), so we are modeling only the repeat cruises from 2010 to 2014 (i.e., customers whose only cruise came in 2009 have taken zero repeat cruises during the observation period). Each customer can take at most one cruise per year.

# What we did 
 1. Estimated both a BB and a BG-BB model on these data, and report the parameter estimates. 
 2. Compared observed and predicted “histograms” of the number of cruises.
 3. Predicted future customers
